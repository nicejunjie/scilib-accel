# This is the configuration file to use NVBLAS Library
# Setup the environment variable NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE to specify your own config file.
# By default, if NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE is not defined,
# NVBLAS Library will try to open the file "nvblas.conf" in its current directory
# Example : NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE  /home/cuda_user/my_nvblas.conf
# The config file should have restricted write permissions accesses

# Specify which output log file (default is stderr)
NVBLAS_LOGFILE  nvblas.log
# Enable trace log of every intercepted BLAS calls
NVBLAS_TRACE_LOG_ENABLED

# Use ALL if you want all your GPUs to contribute
# Use ALL0, if you want all your GPUs of the same type as device 0 to contribute

# By default if no GPU are listed, only device 0 will be used

# CAUTION : this option should be used wisely because it can actually
